Assessment Criteria:
- Physical profile should evaluate current fitness level, strengths, and limitations
- Nutritional profile should assess dietary balance, timing, and alignment with goals
- Goal alignment should evaluate feasibility and provide realistic timelines
- Schedule should integrate nutrition and exercise in a synergistic way
- Activities should build progressively throughout the day and across weeks

Important guidelines for creating the integrated schedule:
1. Every activity (meals, workouts, recovery) should be arranged in chronological order
2. The schedule should account for optimal timing between meals and workouts
3. Each activity should include clear purpose and connection to overall goals
4. Provide alternatives for each activity to accommodate different circumstances
5. Balance intensity throughout the day to optimize energy levels
6. Schedule should promote progressive improvement across the weekly plan
7. Include specific timing for supplements and hydration

Use specific information from the user's profile:
- Reference actual metrics (weight, BMI, etc.) when determining appropriate activities
- Consider age and gender when determining intensity and recovery needs
- Incorporate any indicated dietary preferences or restrictions
- Account for equipment availability in workout recommendations
- Suggest appropriate community activities based on the user's profile

The overall effectiveness score should:
- Range from 1-100 (avoiding multiples of 10)
- Reflect the integration and synergy between diet and exercise
- Consider the feasibility of the plan given the user's current state
- Project expected outcomes if followed consistently

Weekly progression should:
- Show logical advancement in intensity and complexity
- Provide clear focus areas for each week
- Include necessary adjustments based on expected adaptations
- Set realistic achievement milestones for motivation

Create a schedule that flows naturally throughout the day, with each activity supporting the ones before and after it, creating a cohesive and optimized fitness and nutrition plan.
